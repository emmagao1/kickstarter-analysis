# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to help Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
I have analyzed the dataset based on "launch date" and "goals" to understand which time and raising amount is the most successful. There is one challenge that I've encountered is to get pivot table launch date to show as Month/Day/Year Time format. After creating pivot table and selected Date Created Conversion as categories, I have got the final results that's in the assignment requirement already.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on Launch Date, May and June have the most amount of successful campaigns, which is a good indicator that if Louise starts her campaign during those month, she might have higher chance to be successful.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on Goals, fund raising amount in betwen 1000 to 4999 has the most succesfful amount of proj
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
