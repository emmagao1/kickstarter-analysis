# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis is to help Louise's play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. In order to do that, we need to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
The analysis is based on the dataset "launch date" and "goals" as those two factors are good indicators of successful campaigns launch time and goals have been achieved.

The challenges we are facing is to decide which month of the year to launch the campaign. As most of the campaign launching date is around May and it has slightly higher successful rate. With the analysis we are performing, there is no clear link between the success rate based on the launching month and the goal each successful campaign has achieved. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Based on Launch Date, May and June have the most amount of successful campaigns, which is a good indicator that if Louise starts her campaign during those month, she might have higher chance to be successful.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Based on Goals, fund raising amount in betwen 1,000 to 4,999 has the most succesfful amount of campaigns and below 1,000 has the most successful percentage rate. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
There is one challenge that I've encountered is to get pivot table launch date to show as Month/Day/Year Time format. After creating pivot table and selected Date Created Conversion as categories, I have got the pivot table to show month of the year and did not need to group the "Row Labels". 
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Most campaigns are launched during May and May campaigns have the highest successful rate of 67%.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Fund raising amount in betwen 1,000 to 4,999 has the most succesfful amount of campaigns and below 1,000 has the most successful percentage rate.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

*The dataset might be biased depending how data is collected. 
*The dataset covers 9 years of campaigns, which might not represent the most recent successful trend.
*The dataset covers a variety type of campaigns, which in Louise's case, we need to understand campaigns that's related to play. The dataset does not classify plays by type, and we do not know the relationship between play type and successful percentage.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

*Campaign based on duration - most campaigns last around 31 days
*Campaign based on Country location - most popular campaign location is in United States
